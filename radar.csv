Office365,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,<p>description of Office 365</p>
Hexagon,Trial,Tools,TRUE,<p>description of Hexagon</p>
Aveva,Assess,Tools,TRUE,<p>description of Aveva</p>
Git,Adopt,Tools,TRUE,<p>Starting from a challenge posed to the Linux community to stop using commercial version control, Git has proved itself. Git embodies a well architected, high performance implementation of distributed version control. Git is powerful, so it should be used with respect, but that power enables agile engineering workflows that simply cannot exist with other tools. Git’s popularity is supported by the existence of GitHub. GitHub combines public and private Git repositories, social networking, and a host of other innovative tools and approaches.</p>
GitLab,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,<p>GitLab is an on-premise Git repository hosting platform that gives proprietary software development teams the familiar and ubiquitous workflow that hosted version control services like GitHub and BitBucket provide OSS developers. While it is available as free community edition software, the commercial enterprise option provides support and deep integration with LDAP servers.</p>
Gradle,Trial,Tools,TRUE,<p>Language-based build tools like Gradle and Rake continue to offer finer-grained abstractions and more flexibility long term than XML and plug-in based tools like Ant and Maven. This allows them to grow gracefully as projects become more complex.</p>
Rancher,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,<p>Rancher is a complete software stack for teams adopting containers. It addresses the operational and security challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters, while providing DevOps teams with integrated tools for running containerized workloads.</p>
Subversion,Hold,Tools,FALSE,<p>Subversion moves back into the Adopt section of the radar because it is a solid version control tool suitable for most teams. We consider Subversion’s features to be the basic standard for a modern version control tool. Thoughtworkers continue to embrace and recommend Distributed Version Control tools such as Git and Mercurial, but we caution that these systems often require deeper understanding to get the most out of them. New to the radar is GitHub, a “social coding” tool supporting both source code hosting and social networking. GitHub is arguably one of the main reasons Git has become the leading DVCS tool, and GitHub’s collaboration features are often used by enterprises that need to support distributed teams.</p>
Universe,Hold,Tools,FALSE,<p>description of Universe</p>
wIntegrate,Hold,Tools,FALSE,<p>description of wIntegrate</p>
Docker,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,<p>Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. </p>
IIS,Assess,Platforms,TRUE,<p>Internet Information Services (IIS) for Windows® Server is a flexible, secure and manageable Web server for hosting anything on the Web.</p>
Kestrel,Trial,Platforms,TRUE,<p>Kestrel is a cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core. Kestrel is the web server that's included and enabled by default in ASP.</p>
Kubernetes,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,<p>Kubernetes has become the container orchestration platform of choice for major public cloud platforms, including Microsoft's Azure Container Service and Google Cloud (see the GKE blip). And there are many useful products enriching the fast-growing Kubernetes ecosystem.</p>
Application Servers,Hold,Platforms,FALSE,<p>The rise of containers, phoenix servers and continuous delivery has seen a move away from the usual approach to deploying web applications. Traditionally we have built an artifact and then installed that artifact into an application server. The result was long feedback loops for changes, increased build times and the not insignificant overhead of managing these application servers in production. Many of them are a pain to automate too. Most teams we work with favor bundling an embedded http server within your web application. There are plenty of options available: Jetty, SimpleWeb, Webbit and Owin Self-Host amongst others. Easier automation, easier deployment and a reduction in the amount of infrastructure you have to manage lead us to recommend embedded servers over application servers for future projects.</p>
Bare Metal Servers,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,<p>A bare-metal server is a physical computer server that is used by one consumer, or tenant, only.[1] Each server offered for rental is a distinct physical piece of hardware that is a functional server on its own. They are not virtual servers running in multiple pieces of shared hardware.</p>
Server-Side Rendering,Adopt,Techniques,FALSE,<p>Server-side rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering web pages on a server and passing them to the browser (client-side), instead of rendering them in the browser. SSR sends a fully rendered page to the client; the client’s JavaScript bundle takes over and enables the SPA framework to operate.</p>
CQRS,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,<p>CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS in your application can maximize its performance, scalability, and security. The flexibility created by migrating to CQRS allows a system to better evolve over time and prevents update commands from causing merge conflicts at the domain level.</p>
Infrastructure as Code,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,<p>Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.[1] The IT infrastructure managed by this process comprises both physical equipment, such as bare-metal servers, as well as virtual machines, and associated configuration resources.</p>
Micro frontends,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,<p>The idea behind Micro Frontends is to think about a website or web app as a composition of features which are owned by independent teams. Each team has a distinct area of business or mission it cares about and specialises in. A team is cross functional and develops its features end-to-end, from database to user interface.</p>
Microservice Architecture,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,<p>A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.</p>
Single Page App (SPA),Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,<p>A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.</p>
Software Bill of Materials,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,<p>With continued pressure to keep systems secure and no reduction in the general threat landscape, a machine-readable Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) may help teams stay on top of security problems in the libraries that they rely on. The recent Log4Shell zero-day remote exploit was critical and widespread, and if teams had had an SBOM ready, it could have been scanned for and fixed quickly. We've now had production experience using SBOMs on projects ranging from small companies to large multinationals and even government departments, and we're convinced they provide a benefit. Tools such as Syft make it easy to use an SBOM for vulnerability detection.</p>
Shared State,Hold,Techniques,FALSE,<p>Shared mutable state works as follows: If two or more parties can change the same data (variables, objects, etc.). And if their lifetimes overlap. Then there is a risk of one party’s modifications preventing other parties from working correctly.</p>
Angular,Assess,Languages & frameworks,TRUE,<p>Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.</p>
.NET 6,Trial,Languages & frameworks,TRUE,<p>We don't call out every new .NET version in the Radar, but .NET 6 represents a significant step forward in bringing .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single platform. Organizations should start to develop a strategy to migrate their development environments — a fragmented mix of frameworks depending on the deployment target — to a single version of .NET 6. The advantage of this approach will be a common development platform regardless of the intended environment: Windows, Linux, cross-platform mobile devices (via Xamarin) or the browser (using Blazor). While polyglot development will remain the preferred approach for companies with the engineering culture to support it, others will find it more efficient to standardize on a single platform for .NET development.</p>
Java 17,Adopt,Languages & frameworks,TRUE,<p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
React.js,Adopt,Languages & frameworks,TRUE,<p>In the avalanche of front-end JavaScript frameworks, React.js stands out due to its design around a reactive data flow. Allowing only one-way data binding greatly simplifies the rendering logic and avoids many of the issues that commonly plague applications written with other frameworks.</p>
Spring Boot,Adopt,Languages & frameworks,TRUE,<p>A lot of work has gone into Spring Boot to reduce complexity and dependencies, which largely alleviates our previous reservations. If you live in a Spring ecosystem and are moving to microservices, Spring Boot is now the obvious choice.</p>
Java 4,Hold,Languages & frameworks,FALSE,<p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
Java EE,Hold,Languages & frameworks,FALSE,<p>Jakarta EE, formerly Java Platform, Enterprise Edition and Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, is a set of specifications, extending Java SE with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services.</p>
